# Password Generator Project

## Overview

This Python code is a password generator. It asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password, and then creates a password based on their preferences.

## Topics Covered

- **Importing Necessary Modules**: 
  - The script starts by importing the `random` module, which is used to generate random elements.

- **Lists of Characters**: 
  - Three lists are created: `letters`, `numbers`, and `symbols`. These lists contain characters that can be used to generate the password.

- **Welcome Message**: 
  - The script prints a welcome message to greet the user.

- **User Input**:
  - The script prompts the user to enter how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.

- **Generating the Password**:
  - It creates an empty list called `password_list` to store the characters of the password.
  - For each desired letter, the script randomly selects a letter from the `letters` list and adds it to the `password_list`.
  - Similarly, for each desired symbol and number, the script randomly selects a symbol or number respectively, and adds it to the `password_list`.

- **Shuffling and Concatenating**:
  - After all the characters are added to the `password_list`, it shuffles the characters randomly to mix them up.
  - Then, it concatenates all the characters in the `password_list` to form the final password.

- **Output**:
  - Finally, the script prints out the generated password for the user to see.

This script allows users to quickly create a unique and secure password tailored to their preferences.
