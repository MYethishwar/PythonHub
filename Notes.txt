🌻 Object Oriented Programming🌻
In object oriented programming we are trying to model the real life objects and do things.
The things include
1, Attributes:- in general It describes about what it has.
2, Methods:- In general it is a function which tell about what an object does.
example:- class:- waiter, objects:- Preethi, chintu, yethish.
-> class names are defined in a way that each word starting with capital letter.(Pascal Case)

📝->PascalCase:- all starting letters of a word in a class name is capitalized.
  ->camelCase:- The first letter is small and the subsequent starting words are capitalized.
  ->snake_case:- all words are separated by a underscore.
➡️#Creating a class
 class classsName:
	#content here if there is no content use pass keyword to avoid errors.
 #Creating a object from the above class
 obj = ClassName()
➡️Constructors
__init__:- It is a special method called everytime when an object is created and used to initialize the variables which are frequently used.
class User:
    def __init__(self,name,f_name):
        self.id = '97'
        self.name = name
        self.father_name = f_name
user_1 = User("Yethishwar","Surendhar Rao")
print(f"My name is {user_1.name}.\nMy father name is {user_1.father_name}.\nRoll no:- {user_1.id}")
