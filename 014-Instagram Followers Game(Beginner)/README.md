### 3. External Libraries

- Using the `random` module to make random selections
- Using the `os` module to clear the console screen

### 4. Data Structures

- Dictionaries: Storing and accessing profile data

### 5. User Input

- Taking user input to determine the user's choice

### 6. String Formatting

- Formatting strings to display profile information

### 7. Conditional Logic

### 8. Control Flow

- Looping until a condition is met (`while` loop)
- Breaking out of a loop

### 9. Clearing Console Screen

- Using the `os` module to clear the console screen for a better user experience

### 10. Documentation

- Providing comments within the code for clarity

### 11. Error Handling
