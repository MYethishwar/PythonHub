# Make a Guess Game

## Description

This project is a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy and hard.

## Topics Covered

### Namespaces

Namespaces organizes the names used in a Python program, preventing naming conflicts and providing a way to access variables, functions, and other objects in a structured manner.

#### Global Namespace

The global namespace refers to the namespace at the highest level of the program. In Python, when you define variables or functions outside of any function or class, they belong to the global namespace.

#### Local Namespace

The local namespace refers to the namespace within a function or a code block. In Python, when you define variables or functions inside a function, they belong to the local namespace of that function.
